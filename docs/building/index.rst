Most users will likely want to build ``scc`` using :ref:`cmake <cmake_build>`. This is sufficient for building
the library but not for documentation and tests. The latter require using scc's :ref:`make-based <make_build>`
build system. This is far more sophisticated than the cmake ditto but also likely to be less portable.
